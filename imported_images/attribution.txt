The preview image was created using the Widget Preview app on an emulated Nexus 5 running API 24.




I made the PolyCal icon in GIMP, using two images (attribution below) as source material. I
noticed that the "Asset Studio" application built-in to Android Studio creates icon sizes at
108, 162, 216, 324, and 432. To accommodate all these sizes, I worked at 1296x1296, which
is the least common multiple of that list of numbers.
